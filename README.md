# Linear Regression train by Gradient Descent and Visualize It
## Description
* Use Python Numpy and matplotlib, simply implement Linear Regression and show training weight trace in each step <br>also visualize with contour figure.
## Implement Details
* Goal: Consider Following Data: 
```python=
x_data=[338, 333, 328, 207, 226, 25, 179, 60, 208, 606]

y_data=[640, 633, 619, 393, 428,27, 193, 66, 226, 1591]
```
* So we need to fit a function $Y = W*X$
## Result
